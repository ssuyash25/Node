Tree : Non-linear DS contains a root and child Nodes
Binary Tree : Contains at most two children for one Parent
BST : BT where each Child on left is less and each child on the right is more than its parent

BST :-

Time Complexity :-
Best / Average Case :-
Insertion - O(log n)
Searching - O(log n)

Worst Case :- Valid BST but not in good Structure
Not Guaranteed 


Tree Traversal :-
BFS : Breath First Search
DFS : Deapth First Search
Time Complexity of BFS and DFS is same
Space Complexity :- 
Wide Tree :- BFS Takes more Space
Long Tree :- DFS Takes more Space

Use Cases :-
Inorder BST : We get the data is Order, so used for 
PreOrder BST : Flatten the Tree
