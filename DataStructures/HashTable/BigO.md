HashTables : Collections of Key-Value Pairs
           : Work by hashing the KEY
           : A good hash should be fast, distribute keys uniformly
           : Two Strategies to deal with in case of hash collision :
            1) Separate Chaining : Storing to-gether in an nested Structure
            2) Linear probing : Looking forward for next empty spot

Good Hash Function : that distributes the Data uniformly
